# Fractal-Tree-Animation-Part2
This project generates stunning and colorful fractal trees using Python's turtle graphics module. Each branch of the tree is drawn recursively with randomized vibrant colors, making every run unique and mesmerizing.
📚🌳 Features

Dynamic Color Variation: Each branch level renders with unique and vibrant colors for an eye-catching effect.

Recursive Tree Structure: Implements a recursive function to draw complex fractal branches.

Customizable Parameters: Easily adjust branch length, recursion depth, and colors to modify the tree's appearance.

Turtle Animation: Utilizes Turtle graphics for smooth, animated rendering.
